#+title: Types Of Security Audits

* internal audits
- conducted by the organization internal audit team or security professionals to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with policies

- internal audits provide insight into the organization self-assessment of its security posture and highlight areas that may require more in-depth testing

- an internal audit might review user access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive datamation

* external audits
- performed by independent third-party auditors to provide an unbiased evaluation of the organization security measures and compliance with external standards

- external audits often serve as benchmarks for compliance and security effectiveness. penetration testers can use these findings to guide their testing efforts

- a company undergoing a PCI DSS compliance audit might hire an external auditor to validate its security  control and ensure they meet the required standards

* compliance audits
- focus on verifying that the organization complies with specific regulatory requirements and industry standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

- Compliance audits help identify regulatory gaps that penetration testers can address through targeted testing

- a healthcare provider might undergo a HIPAA compliance audit to ensure that patient data is protected according to federal regulations

* technical audits
- focusing on assessing the technical aspects of the organization IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network configurations

- technical audits provides a detailed view of the technical controls in place, highlighting areas where penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities

- a technical audit might involve a thorough review of firewall configurations to ensure they are properly securing the network perimeter

* network audits
- assess the security of the organization network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices

- network audits can reveal vulnerabilities in network design and configurations that penetration testers can exploit to assess network security

- a network audit might identify insecure protocols being used for data transmission, prompting penetration testers to test for potential exploits

* applicaiton audits
- evaluate the security of software applications, focusing on code quality, input validation, authentication mechanisms, and data handling

- applications audits highlight security flaws in applications that penetration testers can exploit to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios

- an application audit might reveal vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting in a web application
