* intro
windows remote management (WinRM) is a windows remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems over HTTPS

Microsoft implemented WinRM in to WIndows in order to make life easier for system administrators

- remotely access and interact with WIndows hosts on a local network
- remotely access and execute commands on Windows Systems
- Manage and configure windows systems remotely

winRM typically uses TCP port 5985 and 5986 (HTTPS)


* exploiting winRM
winrm implements access control and security for communication between systems through various forms of authentication

we can utilize a utility called "crackmapexec" to perform a brute-force on WinRM in order to identify users and their passwords as well as execute commands on the target system

we can also utilize a ruby script called "evil-winrm" to obtain a command shell session on the target system
