#+title: Host Network Ctf2

* intro
Linux-based systems are frequently targeted in penetration tests due to their prevalence in server environments. This lab focuses on using the Metasploit Framework (MSF) to exploit misconfigured services and vulnerable applications on Linux systems.

Participants will leverage MSF to enumerate services, explore file systems, and exploit web applications to achieve shell access.
