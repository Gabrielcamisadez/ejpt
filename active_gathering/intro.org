* DNS
domain name system is a protocol that is used to resolve domain names/hostnames to IP addresses

during the early days of the internet, users would have to remember the IP address of the sites that they wanted to visit, DNS resolves this issues by mapping domain names

* DNS Records
- A --> Resolves hostnames or domain to an IPv4 addresses
- AAAA --> Resolves a hostname or domain to an IPv6 addresses
- NS --> Reference to the domain nameserver
- MX --> Resolves a domain to a mail server
- CNAME --> Used for domain aliases
- TXT --> Text record
- HINFO --> Host information
- SOA --> Domain authority
- SRV --> Service Records
- PTR --> Resolves an IP Address to a hostname

* DNS Interrogation
- DNS interrogation is the process of enumerating DNS records for a specific domain

- The objective of DNS interrogation is to probe a DNS server to provide use with DNS records for a specific domain

- This process can provide with important information like the IP address of a domain, subdomains, mail server addresses etc

* DNS zone transfer
- DNS server admins may want to copy or transfer zone files from one DNS server to another. This process is known as a zone transfer

- If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone file from the primary DNS server to another DNS server

- A DNS zone transfer can provide penetration testers with a holistic view of an organization network layout

- Furthermore, in certain cases, internal network addresses may be found on an organization DNS serverb
